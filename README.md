Analysis of Probability of winning, tie or losing a hand at blackjack.
This code simulates a game of blackjack with a dealer and a single player. It creates a deck of cards, deals them to the player and dealer, and then makes decisions based on the player's total value of cards. The player hits randomly until they either bust or choose to stop, and then the dealer plays according to set rules until they either bust or choose to stop. The results of the game are recorded and stored in a list. The code runs this simulation a number of times and outputs some information about the results.
The code uses a basic strategy of hitting randomly, which is not optimal, but it could be modified to implement a more advanced strategy. Additionally, it only simulates one player, but it could be modified to simulate multiple players or a group of players playing against the dealer. Overall, this code seems to provide a good framework for simulating and analyzing different blackjack strategies.
