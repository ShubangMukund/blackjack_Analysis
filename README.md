Analysis of Probability of winning, tie or losing a hand at blackjack.

This code simulates a game of blackjack with a dealer and a single player. It creates a deck of cards, deals them to the player and dealer, and then makes decisions based on the player's total value of cards. The player hits randomly until they either bust or choose to stop, and then the dealer plays according to set rules until they either bust or choose to stop. The results of the game are recorded and stored in a list. The code runs this simulation a number of times and outputs some information about the results.The dealer is simulated to hit until they have a hand with a total value of at least 17. The player is simulated to hit randomly until they have a hand with a total value of at least 21, or until they bust. The code tracks the results of the player's hand and the dealer's hand for a number of game iterations, and saves the results in three lists: dealer_card_feature, player_card_feature, and player_results.

dealer_card_feature is a list of lists, where each sublist corresponds to the dealer's initial two cards for each game iteration. player_card_feature is a list of lists, where each sublist corresponds to the player's final hand for each game iteration. player_results is a list of lists, where each sublist corresponds to the result of the player's hand for each game iteration (-1 for a loss, 0 for a tie, and 1 for a win).

The code uses a function total_up to calculate the total value of a hand of cards, including accounting for the value of Aces. The function ace_values is used by total_up to list out all possible values for Aces in the hand, accounting for the fact that Aces can have a value of 1 or 11.

The code also uses the make_decks function to create a deck of cards for the game, and the get_ace_values function to list out all permutations of Ace values in a hand.

Overall, the code is a simulation of a simplified game of Blackjack with only one player and one dealer, with the player hitting randomly until they have a hand with a value of at least 21, and the dealer hitting until they have a hand with a value of at least 17. The simulation results are saved in three lists: dealer_card_feature, player_card_feature, and player_results. The code uses a basic strategy of hitting randomly, which is not optimal, but it could be modified to implement a more advanced strategy. Additionally, it only simulates one player, but it could be modified to simulate multiple players or a group of players playing against the dealer. Overall, this code seems to provide a good framework for simulating and analyzing different blackjack strategies.
